- **Custom Tag Filters**: Arbitrary single-letter tag/value pairs (excludes reserved e, p, t)
- **Content Keywords**: Word boundary matching for content-based filtering
- **Local Filters**: Client-side filtering for enhanced control:
  - **Exclude Mentions to Self**: Filter events where authors mention themselves
  - **Exclude Replies to Events**: Filter replies from filtered authors

### Settings & Optimization
- **Battery Modes**: Choose between Performance, Balanced, or Battery Saver modes
- **Notification Settings**: Configure frequency and rate limiting
- **Debug Console**: Toggle structured logging and performance metrics
- **Default Configuration**: Set default relay server and event viewer URLs

### Integration Features
