## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Keystore Security**: Your keystore file and passwords are critical. Losing them means you cannot update your app.

2. **Package Name**: Once published, you cannot change the package name (`com.frostr.pubsub`).

3. **Permissions**: Google Play reviews apps with sensitive permissions carefully. Document why each permission is needed.

4. **Target API**: Ensure you're targeting the latest API level required by Google Play.

5. **Testing**: Use Google Play Console's internal testing track before releasing to production.

```bash
# Generate keystore (run once)
./generate_keystore.sh

# Build production release
./build_release.sh

# Build beta version for closed testing
./build_beta.sh

# Manual Gradle commands:
./gradlew assembleRelease    # Production APK
./gradlew bundleRelease      # Production AAB
./gradlew assembleBeta       # Beta APK
./gradlew bundleBeta         # Beta AAB
