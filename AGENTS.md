# AGENTS.md - PubSub Android App

## Project Overview
**PubSub** is a native Android application that provides persistent Nostr push notifications for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). It maintains background connections to Nostr relays and forwards events via notifications and deep links.

### Core Purpose
- Keep PWAs connected to the Nostr "fire-hose" when they're not active
- Provide real-time event notifications with callback URIs
- Enable background monitoring of Nostr events with persistent connections
