## Scripts Overview

### üîß `version.sh` - Version Management
**Purpose**: Set and manage the app version independently of releases.

**Key Features**:
- Show current version from `build.gradle.kts`
- Set specific version (e.g., `1.2.0`)
- Bump version automatically (`--bump-patch`, `--bump-minor`, `--bump-major`)
- Validates semantic versioning format
- Creates backup before changes

**Common Usage**:
```bash
./script/version.sh                    # Show current version
./script/version.sh 1.2.0             # Set version to 1.2.0
./script/version.sh --bump-patch       # Increment patch (0.9.5 ‚Üí 0.9.6)
```

**When to use**: Set version ahead of development, before starting work on a new feature.

---

### üèóÔ∏è `build.sh` - Debug Build
**Purpose**: Build debug APK for development and testing.

**Key Features**:
- Builds debug version with `-debug` suffix
- Places APK in `dist/` folder for easy access
- Shows installation instructions
- Optional clean build (`--clean`)
- Displays APK size and location

**Common Usage**:
```bash
./script/build.sh                      # Standard debug build
./script/build.sh --clean              # Clean build from scratch
```

**Output**: `dist/pubsub-{version}-debug.apk`

**When to use**: When you need a debug APK for manual testing or distribution to testers.

---

### üì± `install.sh` - Build and Install
**Purpose**: One-command build and install on connected device.

**Key Features**:
- Builds debug APK
- Automatically detects connected devices
- Installs APK with `-r` flag (replace if exists)
- Shows device connection status
- Provides launch instructions

**Common Usage**:
```bash
./script/install.sh                    # Build and install on device
```

**Prerequisites**: Device connected with USB debugging enabled, or emulator running.

**When to use**: During active development for quick install-and-test cycles.

---

### üß™ `test.sh` - Test Runner
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test execution with reporting.

**Key Features**:
- Runs unit tests, instrumented tests, and lint checks
- Selective test execution (`--unit`, `--instrumented`, `--lint`)
- HTML report generation (`--report`)
- Device detection for instrumented tests
- Colored output and detailed summaries

**Common Usage**:
```bash
./script/test.sh                       # Run all tests
./script/test.sh --unit                # Unit tests only
./script/test.sh --clean --report      # Clean build with reports
```

**When to use**: Before commits, during CI/CD, or when validating changes.

---

### üöÄ `dev.sh` - Development Environment
**Purpose**: Start and manage Android emulator for development.

**Key Features**:
- Automatically starts first available AVD
- Port forwarding for local services (`-p 3000,8080`)
- Graceful shutdown with cleanup
- Force kill all emulators (`-k`)
- Optimized emulator settings for development

**Common Usage**:
```bash
./script/dev.sh                        # Start emulator
./script/dev.sh -p 3000                # Start with port forwarding
./script/dev.sh -k                     # Kill all emulators
```

**Interactive**: Press 'q' to quit and cleanup emulator.

**When to use**: When you need a clean emulator environment for development or testing.

---

### üéØ `release.sh` - Production Release
**Purpose**: Create production builds and manage git tags for releases.

**Key Features**:
- Reads version from `build.gradle.kts` (no version arguments accepted)
- Builds signed AAB and APK for production
- Creates and pushes git tags
- GitHub Actions integration
- Force tag recreation for failed releases

**Common Usage**:
```bash
./script/release.sh                    # Full release process
./script/release.sh --skip-build       # Only create git tag
./script/release.sh --github-only      # Tag only, let GitHub build
```

**Prerequisites**: 
- Version set via `./script/version.sh`
- Keystore configured (run `./script/keystore.sh` first)

**When to use**: When ready to create an official release build.

---

### üîê `keystore.sh` - Keystore Generation
**Purpose**: Generate signing keystore for Google Play Store releases.

**Key Features**:
- Creates production keystore with proper settings
- Generates base64 encoding for GitHub Actions
- Provides GitHub Secrets setup instructions
- Security best practices guidance
- 10,000-day validity period

**Common Usage**:
```bash
./script/keystore.sh                   # Generate keystore (run once)
```

**Output**: 
- `pubsub-release.keystore` file
- GitHub Actions configuration instructions

**When to use**: One-time setup before first production release.

## Workflow Examples

### üîÑ Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Set version for new feature
./script/version.sh 1.1.0

# 2. Start development environment
./script/dev.sh -p 3000

# 3. Build and test during development
./script/install.sh
./script/test.sh --unit

# 4. Final testing before release
./script/test.sh --clean --report
```

### üöÄ Release Workflow
```bash
# 1. Ensure version is set
./script/version.sh --show

# 2. Run full test suite
./script/test.sh --clean --report

# 3. Create release (builds and tags)
./script/release.sh

# 4. Verify release artifacts
ls -la app/build/outputs/
```

### üß™ Testing Workflow
```bash
# Quick unit tests during development
./script/test.sh --unit

# Full test suite before commits
./script/test.sh --clean --report

# Instrumented tests (requires device)
./script/dev.sh &  # Start emulator in background
./script/test.sh --instrumented
```

---

## Dependencies

### Required Tools
- **Android SDK**: `adb`, `emulator` commands
- **Java/Kotlin**: For Gradle builds
- **Git**: For release tagging

### Optional Tools
- **keytool**: For keystore generation (usually included with Java)
- **base64**: For GitHub Actions setup (standard on most systems)

---

## File Outputs

### Build Artifacts
- `dist/pubsub-{version}-debug.apk` - Debug builds from `build.sh`
- `app/build/outputs/apk/release/pubsub-{version}-release.apk` - Release APK
- `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/pubsub-{version}-release.aab` - Release AAB

### Test Reports
- `app/build/reports/tests/` - Unit test HTML reports
- `app/build/reports/lint-results/` - Lint check reports
- `app/build/reports/androidTests/` - Instrumented test reports

### Configuration
- `pubsub-release.keystore` - Production signing keystore
- `.env` - Local environment variables (keystore passwords)

---

## Best Practices

### Version Management
1. **Set version before development**: Use `version.sh` to set target version
2. **Semantic versioning**: Follow `major.minor.patch` format
3. **Commit version changes**: `git add app/build.gradle.kts && git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"`

### Testing
1. **Test early and often**: Use `test.sh --unit` during development
2. **Full test suite**: Run `test.sh --clean --report` before releases
3. **Device testing**: Use `install.sh` for manual device testing

### Release Process
1. **Version first**: Set version with `version.sh`
2. **Test thoroughly**: Full test suite with reports
3. **Release once**: Use `release.sh` for official releases
4. **GitHub integration**: Tags trigger automated builds

### Security
1. **Never commit keystores**: Keep `pubsub-release.keystore` out of git
2. **Use GitHub Secrets**: Store sensitive data securely
3. **Backup keystores**: Store in secure password manager

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No devices found"**
- Start emulator: `./script/dev.sh`
- Check USB debugging on physical device
- Verify with: `adb devices`

**"Keystore not found"**
- Generate keystore: `./script/keystore.sh`
- Ensure file exists: `ls -la pubsub-release.keystore`

**"Version not found"**
- Set version first: `./script/version.sh 1.0.0`
- Check build.gradle.kts has `versionName` field

**"Build failed"**
- Clean build: `./gradlew clean`
- Check Java/Android SDK versions
- Verify dependencies in `build.gradle.kts`

### Getting Help

Each script includes built-in help:
```bash
./script/{script-name}.sh --help
```

For example:
```bash
./script/version.sh --help
./script/release.sh --help
```
