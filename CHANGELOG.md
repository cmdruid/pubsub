- **FIXED: Debug Console Filter Bug**: Resolved issue where debug console filter would default to disabled or randomly disable all logs
  - Fixed filter corruption during dialog initialization by reordering setup sequence
  - Added validation to prevent saving corrupted filters with empty types/domains
  - Implemented automatic recovery from corrupted filter states
  - Added safety defaults to ensure ERROR and WARN logs are always visible

- **FIXED: Duplicate Detection Metrics**: Resolved issue where "Duplicates Detected" and "Network Data Saved" metrics always showed zero
  - Added tracking for timestamp-based duplicate prevention (the primary duplicate prevention mechanism)
  - Enhanced EventCache duplicate detection with proper metrics tracking
  - Implemented bandwidth savings calculation for prevented duplicate events
  - Added precise timestamp usage rate tracking

- **FIXED: Network Quality Detection**: Enhanced network quality detection that was causing overly conservative health thresholds

  - Developed `HealthMonitorV2` with synchronous testing support via `runHealthCheckSync()`
  - Added comprehensive test coverage with 25+ focused tests

- **Enhanced Event Processing**: Improved event processing pipeline with better validation and metrics
  - Added comprehensive subscription ID validation to prevent cross-subscription contamination
  - Enhanced event processing metrics tracking for all processed events
  - Improved error handling and logging throughout the event pipeline

### üìä Metrics & Logging Improvements

- **Health Monitoring Tests**: Pure unit tests for health evaluation logic
- **User Scenario Tests**: Tests that reproduce and validate fixes for reported issues

### üìà Performance & Reliability

- **Improved Subscription Continuity**: Enhanced subscription renewal prevents service interruptions
- **Better Resource Management**: Proper metrics tracking reveals system performance and optimization opportunities
- **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from corrupted states and connection failures
- **Reduced Debug Noise**: Proper log level categorization improves debugging efficiency
